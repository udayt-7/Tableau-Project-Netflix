# Tableau-Project-Netflix

This is a course project that I have done to complete my 5-Course Tableau Specialization from Coursera(UC Davis). I have downloaded the Netflix viewing history data of a 4 user - 5 screen account that I and my friends have been sharing since December 2019. The timeline of the data is 9 months (Dec 2019-Aug 2020). I extracted a CSV file with 10 columns in which only 5 are relevant columns [Timestamp, Title, Duration, Type, Movie] from Netflix viewing history page(https://www.netflix.com/settings/viewed). This page is user-profile specific, hence I downloaded a separate file for each user and merged all 5 of them into one excel file. Before starting my analysis, I created new columns to split the data of some details in the file, I also created new calculated fields, Parameters, Bins, and Sets using Tableau to help my analysis.
